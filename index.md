# hi!

## Here's me in ~10 seconds
I'm a PhD candidate at [Goldsmiths UoL](https://www.gold.ac.uk/), (part of [IGGI CDT](http://www.iggi.org.uk/)) exploring human perception and interaction with virtual humans in immersive [6DoF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_degrees_of_freedom) Virtual Environments. 

## If you're not bored already, here's me again in a few more seconds
I  am founded by [EPSRC](https://epsrc.ukri.org/) through [IGGI CDT](http://www.iggi.org.uk/) to continue my studies as a PhD student. IGGI stands for Intelligent Games and Game Intelligence and it is a Centre for Doctoral Training with students across  4 Universities: York University, Goldsmiths UoL, Queen Mary UoL and Essex University.

I'm investigating autonomous agents (or virtual humans) in social settings in terms of non-verbal interactions with users.  I'm interested in the underlying mechanics of social interaction that helps developing an emphatic and engaging virtual human. I have a theoretical background in Computer Science, completing with distinction an undergraduate degree in 2017. My thesis explored automatic detection of duplicate questions in community-based question answering platforms by learning semantic representation of queries.

Here are some of [my current and past projects](./projects.html), here's [what I'm doing now](./now.html).
