# hi!
<br><br>
### Me- for those in a rush
Iâ€™m a PhD candidate at [Goldsmiths UoL](https://www.gold.ac.uk/), (part of [IGGI CDT](http://www.iggi.org.uk/)) exploring the nonverbal behaviour of virtual humans in [6DoF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_degrees_of_freedom) VR, aiming towards autonomous virtual humans. Recently we won the [1st prize](https://twitter.com/htcvive/status/1221865150916882433) at the VIVE dev jam, I was an intern at [DRi](https://www.dreamrealityinteractive.com/), and received three scholarships awards: [Google Women Techmakers](https://www.womentechmakers.com/) and the [Rabin Ezra](http://rabinezrascholarship.org/) (2020 and 2021). 
Currently, I work on building nonverbal behaviour models from multimodal datasets to detect various social signals or to drive autonomous agents in VR games.



### A few more details...
I  am funded by [EPSRC](https://epsrc.ukri.org/) through [IGGI CDT](http://www.iggi.org.uk/) to continue my studies as a PhD student. IGGI stands for Intelligent Games and Game Intelligence and it is a Centre for Doctoral Training with students across  4 Universities: York University, Goldsmiths UoL, Queen Mary UoL and Essex University.

My current focus is on the nonverbal cues that influence and shape the social interaction in immersive VR environments. More broadly, I'm investigating autonomous agents (or virtual humans) in social settings in terms of non-verbal interactions with users. I'm interested in the underlying mechanics of social interaction that help developing an emphatic and engaging virtual human. At the moment, I'm working on ML models based on multimodal datasets to detect various social cues (such as gaze) or various human-defined concepts (such as engagement) in social interactions in VR. Using the same pipeline, I'm also interested in generating more complex behaviour for virtual characters (NPCs) that will improve the user's experience with the NPCs in a social VR setting.  
I have a theoretical background in Computer Science, completing with distinction an undergraduate degree in 2017. My thesis explored automatic detection of duplicate questions in community-based question answering platforms by learning semantic representation of queries.

Recently, I was awarded two Scholarships (Rabin Ezra and Google Women Techmakers); to find out more about these and others, have a look at [this selection of things I've done](./projects.html); Here's also [what I'm doing now](./now.html).
