# **this is what I'm doing right now**
<br><br>
## Work

Currently I'm on an internship at [Dream Reality Interactive (DRi)](https://www.dreamrealityinteractive.com/) studio, working on an AI framework to let the NPCs respond to players' social cues in VR games, leading to more engaging and lifelke interactions. This is part of an InnovateUK funded project to develop a 'Peaky Blinders' VR Game, together with [Maze Theory](https://www.maze-theory.com/) and [Goldsmiths UoL](https://www.gold.ac.uk). Here's a [Forbes article](https://www.forbes.com/sites/hnewman/2019/04/25/new-peaky-blinders-vr-game-characters-will-use-a-i-to-react-to-you/) about it.

## Studies

Apart from the work I'm doing at DRi, I'm preparing a Workshop for [IGGI conference](http://www.2019.iggi.org.uk/) on Imitation Learning for games. You can now [register](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/imitation-learning-for-unity-games-tickets-69724613195) and get a (free) ticket. The annual Intelligent Games and Games Intelligence conference is taking place in York this year on the 11th-12th of September. There are 4 Keynotes and 60+ PhD students showing their work.
