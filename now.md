### Work & Studies

I've started my PhD exploring the conversational dynamics of low-level nonverbal cues from **people**. I went a level up, looking into how to detect users' higher-level nonverbal behaviours (social attitudes) to help drive **agents**. Now, I'm focusing on a different aspect of social interactions in virtual environments: **avatars**. This last part continues the summer project started with MSR Cambridge in 2021. It involves qualitative and quantitative data analysis.
