# **this is what I'm doing right now**
<br><br>
## Work

Currently I'm on an internship at [Dream Reality Interactive (DRi)](https://www.dreamrealityinteractive.com/) studio, working on an AI framework to let the NPCs respond to players' social cues in VR games, leading to more engaging and lifelke interactions. This is part of an InnovateUK funded project to develop a 'Peaky Blinders' VR Game, together with [Maze Theory](https://www.maze-theory.com/) and [Goldsmiths UoL](https://www.gold.ac.uk). Here's a [Forbes article](https://www.forbes.com/sites/hnewman/2019/04/25/new-peaky-blinders-vr-game-characters-will-use-a-i-to-react-to-you/) about it.

## Studies

Apart from the work I'm doing at DRi, I'm preparing a Doctoral Consortium presentation for [ACII](http://acii-conf.org/2019/) and an Workshop for [IGGI conferene](http://www.2019.iggi.org.uk/). Stay tuned for mode details soon! :)
