### Work & Studies

I've started my PhD exploring the conversational dynamics on low-level nonverbal cues. Now, I'm back at it: gaze behaviour and speech, turn-taking and dyadic conversational dynamics, automatic conversational turn detection. This is what I'm focusing on, ahead of a very exciting **summer internship**!
