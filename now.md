## Work&Studies

I'm undertaking exploratory research on dyadic conversation with a slight focus on low-level verbal and non-verbal cues that influence the overall interaction between people. Currently, I'm looking at gaze behaviour and conversational turns.

I've started working on some facial mo-cap and animation which is both fun and challenging since I'm not coming from that background. I've also got my Halloween look ready!

## Events 
#### VSI 2018
Along with Patrik Falk, I'm helping to organise the [4th Workshop on Virtual Social Interaction](https://sites.google.com/view/vsi2018/home) that is organised by [Prof. Antonia Hamilton](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/icn/research/research-groups/social-neuroscience), [Dr. Marco Gillies](https://www.doc.gold.ac.uk/~mas02mg/MarcoGillies/) and [Dr. Silvia Pan](https://sites.google.com/site/panxueni/). It will take place on 17-18 Decembre 2018 at [Goldsmiths UoL](https://www.gold.ac.uk). There are interesting [keynote speakers](https://sites.google.com/view/vsi2018/confirmed-speakers) lined up, which just happen to be all female: [Prof. Justine Cassell](http://www.justinecassell.com/), [Dr. Agnieszka Wykowska](https://www.iit.it/people/agnieszka-wykowska), [Dr. Rachel McDonnell](https://www.scss.tcd.ie/Rachel.McDonnell/) and [Dr. Mariska Kret](http://www.mariskakret.com/). 
The call for [talks and posters](https://sites.google.com/view/vsi2018/call-for-submissions)  is still open (but only until the 7th of October!). [The registration](https://sites.google.com/view/vsi2018/registration) will open soon, so stayed tuned for that!
