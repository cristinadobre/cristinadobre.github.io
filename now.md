# **What is she doing now?**

## Work&Studies

Currently I'm undertaking exploratory research on dyadic conversation with a slight focus on low-level verbal and non-verbal cues that influence the overall interaction between people.

I'm reading and digesting the theory of social interactions during communication, covering the work of Starkey Duncan, Adam Kendon, Simon Garrod, Martin J. Pickering, Herbert Herb Clark

I'm the posters&demonstration chair for our annual [conference on Intelligence Games and Game Intelligence](http://2018.iggi.org.uk/) that will take place on the 12-13 September 2018 @ [Queen Mary University of London](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/).
