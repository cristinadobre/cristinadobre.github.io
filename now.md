## Work&Studies

Currently I'm undertaking exploratory research on dyadic conversation with a slight focus on low-level verbal and non-verbal cues that influence the overall interaction between people.

I'm reading and digesting the theory of social interactions during communication, covering the work of Starkey Duncan, Adam Kendon, Simon Garrod, Martin J. Pickering, Herbert Herb Clark - wish me luck!

## Events and other cool stuff

I'm the posters&demonstration chair for our annual [conference on Intelligence Games and Game Intelligence](http://2018.iggi.org.uk/) that will take place on the 12-13 September 2018 @ [Queen Mary University of London](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/). If you're interested get a [free ticket](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/iggi-conference-2018-tickets-44359564652)!

On the same note, I'm running a workshop with [Carlos González Díaz](https://twitter.com/@carlotes247) on September 13th at the IGGI Conference. The workshop itself it's called _Interactive Machine Learning for VR Game Controls_: we will be looking at how machine learning can be used with motion controls to create complex and but more natural virtual reality controls for games! You should *definitely* [book your place](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/iggi-conference-workshop-interactive-machine-learning-for-vr-game-controls-tickets-47350390292?aff=erellivmlt) while there are still some available!
