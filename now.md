## Work&Studies

I'm undertaking exploratory research on dyadic conversation with focus on low-level verbal and non-verbal cues that influence the overall interaction between people. Currently, I'm currently looking into machine learning based models to generate non-verbal behaviour.

As a side project, I'm working on markerless facial mocap and animation of very young children. This project is based in [the Dept of Psychiatry from Oxford University](https://www.psych.ox.ac.uk/), and aims to provide young adults resources to develop parenting skills.
