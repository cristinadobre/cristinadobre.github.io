## Work&Studies

I'm undertaking exploratory research on dyadic conversation with a slight focus on low-level verbal and non-verbal cues that influence the overall interaction between people. Currently, I'm looking at gaze behaviour and conversational turns.

I've started working on some facial mo-cap and animation which is both fun and challenging since I'm not coming from that background.




## Events 
#### VSI 2018
The [4th Workshop on Virtual Social Interaction](https://sites.google.com/view/vsi2018/home) took place on 17-18 Decembre 2018 at [Goldsmiths UoL](https://www.gold.ac.uk). It was such an interesting event across both days, featuring [all female keynote speakers](https://sites.google.com/view/vsi2018/confirmed-speakers), a range of inspiring talks and a buzzing [poster session](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16YIk6VZi1BpC2AbecTVtmLEQjfDu4H-zTWRFfr1OLyU/edit#heading=h.a11rhbjrnptk).
