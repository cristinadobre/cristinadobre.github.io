### Work & Studies

After a lot of continuation work on the project started during my internship at [DRi](https://www.dreamrealityinteractive.com/) studio, I'm moving a bit away from social attitude detection to certain social behaviours that are the core of VR training application.

I plan to continue the prototype work done during the VIVE Dev Jam last year (where we won the first prize!). It was focused on ML models in VR active listening scenarios using the user's (and VC's) implicit behaviour.
