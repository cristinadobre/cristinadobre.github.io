## Work & Studies

I'm back at my PhD after I completed my internship at [Dream Reality Interactive (DRi)](https://www.dreamrealityinteractive.com/) studio. I'm stricty focusing on continuing the work started there, which uses an imitation learning approach to detect a human-defined concept within a social interaction between the user and an agent in VR.
