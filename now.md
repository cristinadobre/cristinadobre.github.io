## Work&Studies

I'm undertaking exploratory research on dyadic conversation with a slight focus on low-level verbal and non-verbal cues that influence the overall interaction between people. Currently, I'm looking at gaze behaviour and conversational turns.

I've started working on some facial mo-cap and animation which is both fun and challenging since I'm not coming from that background.




## Events
