## Work&Studies

Currently, I'm using machine learning models to generate and explore gaze and other appropriate nonverbal behaviours, for virtual humans suitable for immersive VR. Using multimodal datasets (think of, video eye data, upper-body motion-capture, audio and video recordings) I’m working on building nonverbal behaviour models that can drive virtual humans' gaze behaviour based on the user’s actions in VR.

*I'm also looking for appropriate placements for my research. If you have any suggestions, please get in touch! :)*

As a side project, I'm working on markerless facial mocap and animation of very young children. This project is based in [the Dept of Psychiatry from Oxford University](https://www.psych.ox.ac.uk/), and aims to provide young adults resources to develop parenting skills.
