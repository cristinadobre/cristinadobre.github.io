# **What is she doing now?**

## Work&Studies

Currently I'm undertaking exploratory research on dyadic conversation with a slight focus on low-level verbal and non-verbal cues that influence the overall interaction between people.

I'm reading and digesting the theory of social interactions during communication, covering the work of Starkey Duncan, Adam Kendon, Simon Garrod, Martin J. Pickering, Herbert Herb Clark
