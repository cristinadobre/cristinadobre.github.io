### Virtual Social Interaction Workshop 2018
December 2018

The [4th Workshop on Virtual Social Interaction](https://sites.google.com/view/vsi2018/home) took place on 17-18 Decembre 2018 at Goldsmiths UoL. I'm glad I had the chance to attend and help organise this event. 

[Marco Gilles](http://www.doc.gold.ac.uk/~mas02mg/MarcoGillies/) wrote a nice overview of the event- have a look at his [VSI18 blogpost](https://medium.com/virtual-reality-virtual-people/virtual-social-interaction-conference-8972dcd9211c). It was indeed, such an interesting workshop across both days, featuring all female keynote speakers, a range of inspiring talks and a buzzing poster session.

If you joined the workshop and want to stay in touch (or if you want to hear updates about it + other related news) join our [VSI Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/embed/?place=forum/virtual-interaction)! 

Oh, and stay tuned for **VSI2020**!!

![W\|E project: Trabi](/assets/img/wetrabi.png)

In August 2018 I took part in this amazing one-week [Signal & Noise workshop](https://www.media.mit.edu/events/mlberlin-signalandnoise/) organised by the [MIT Media Lab](https://www.media.mit.edu/) in Berlin. The track I was part of was  *VR/AR-based learning experience* led by [Scott Greenwald](https://www.media.mit.edu/people/swgreen/projects/). 

We created, indeed, a learning experience about the Berlin Wall based on first-hand escape stories. Media Lab created this [video to showcase the behind-the-scenes process](https://youtu.be/C16gaWamXpg) of our project and Die Welt wrote [this article](https://www.welt.de/kmpkt/article181321644/MIT-Projekt-Wie-du-unter-der-Berliner-Mauer-in-den-Westen-fluechten-kannst.html) about our work! One week was enough to prototype this, but we want to put together a final product, therefore this is an on-going project now- _how exciting_! Find out more about the project and the (great!) people working on it on [W\|E website](http://we-vr.berlin/) and follow us [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/WEVR_Berlin) to see what we are up to! 


## VR Escape Room/Puzzle-like experience
May 2018

![VR Escape Room](/assets/img/vrthingy.PNG)

This is a game prototype for an escaperoom/puzzle-like experience in 6DoF VR. The aim is to exit the room by opening the main door. The main door is initially locked (shown by a red door). To unlock it, the user needs to solve a puzzle. It can be solved by finding the right objects in the room and place them on the table next to their 'trace'. The shapes on the table and the clue on the screen should help the player pick the right objects and solve the puzzle. When the right objects are placed on the table, the door gets unlocked (its colour turns green) and the player can open it and exit the room. Here's a [short overview of how the room looks like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxV6fWVhEZE).

This prototype was created by myself in Unity 3D using Oculus SDK and VRTK for the Game Development module (14/05/18 - 25/05/18).

![QT-Labs](/assets/img/qtlabs.PNG)

This is a VR game created in Unity3D over a weekend during the 2018 Global Game Jam (Queen Mary UoL site). The team had six members: one sound effect & music member, two 3D and 2D artists who created and designed the game assets and three developers. I was one of the three developers, having the role of implementing the game logic and testing the game. Here's our [porject overview on GGJ website](https://globalgamejam.org/2018/games/qt-labs) and here's a [short gameplay.](https://vimeo.com/253292962)

## StarWing Genetica
Nov 2017 

![StarwingGenetica](/assets/img/starwinggenetica.PNG)

This is a game developed in Unity over the course of a 2-weeks Game Development module in Goldsmiths UoL. StarWing Genetica is a one player space-themed shooter game, partly inspired by classic arcade games. In this game, a genetic algorithm is used to evolve better enemy agents over time. [Here's a short gameplay.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4fnTExbxMs&feature=youtu.be)

It was designed and built by a team of three: Charlie Ringer, Valerio Bonametti, and myself.
