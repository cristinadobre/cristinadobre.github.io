## VR Escape Room/Puzzle-like experience
May 2018

This is a game prototype for an escaperoom/puzzle-like experience in 6DoF VR. The aim is to exit the room by opening the main door. The main door is initially locked (shown by a red door). To unlock it, the user needs to solve a puzzle. It can be solved by finding the right objects in the room and place them on the table next to their 'trace'. The shapes on the table and the clue on the screen should help the player pick the right objects and solve the puzzle. When the right objects are placed on the table, the door gets unlocked (its colour turns green) and the player can open it and exit the room. Here's a [short overview of how the room looks like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxV6fWVhEZE).

This prototype was created by myself in Unity 3D using Oculus SDK and VRTK for the Game Development module (14/05/18 - 25/05/18).

This is a VR game created in Unity3D over a weekend during the 2018 Global Game Jam (Queen Mary UoL site). The team had six members: one sound effect & music member, two 3D and 2D artists who created and designed the game assets and three developers. I was one of the three developers, having the role of implementing the game logic and testing the game. Here's our [porject overview on GGJ website](https://globalgamejam.org/2018/games/qt-labs) and here's a [short gameplay.](https://vimeo.com/253292962)

This is a game developed in Unity over the course of a 2-weeks Game Development module in Goldsmiths UoL. StarWing Genetica is a one player space-themed shooter game, partly inspired by classic arcade games. In this game, a genetic algorithm is used to evolve better enemy agents over time. [Here's a short gameplay.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4fnTExbxMs&feature=youtu.be)

It was designed and built by a team of three: Charlie Ringer, Valerio Bonametti, and myself.
